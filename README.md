here are some notes about the task. 

- the project was small so I decided to not use any ui third party

- the task pdf did not mention the styling, so i figured out it would be better to not spend time enhancing it

- the points included with each box was not aligning the boxes in a good way and makes it extremely difficult to manage sizes and responsiveness, so i decided to ignore them and use basic index alignment.
  maybe if it was required as if the canvas should show a predefined image from the server, i could negotiate with the backend team to take a different approach
